## Moving every day
When I'm feeling the pressure of just existing, it's always exercise that I gravitate towards. While it's never the primary goal (usually work or school), it's something that helps me feel more grounded. It achieves a few things and also just simply feels good to do, at least sometimes.

Exercise is usually a catalyst to other habits/behaviors. What I mean by that is, once I start exercising, that usually triggers similar health behaviors: fixing up nutrition/hydration and sleeping. This ripple effect of engaging in this one thing (exercise) then helps me round off myself, which has a secondary effect on motivation and energy.

### Plan, well kind of
While it's unreasonable to say I will wake up tomorrow and become an ironman athlete, wake up at 5am to run/swim/bike, and crush 12 hours of interrupted work, that is not the plan. The plan is simple: move every day. To get more specific, move every day at least for 20 minutes (approximately), and shoot for 3.5 hours / 210 minutes per week (30m per day). This is actually greater than the ASCM guidelines, which recommends 150 minutes of moderate intensity aerobic exercise per week.

### Adding in slack
Moving every day is an ambitious goal, I'll admit that much. Some days, you will not feel like it, or you will have something to do that may get in the way. Therefore, it is unreasonable to expect that out of yourself. To make the plan more realistic, there are a few options:

1. Decision tree of activities: having a menu of exercise options breaks up the monotony and helps you move towards the exercise goal by offering easier choices (walking or stretching instead of cycling or weight training)
2. Break-the-glass activities: stretching, mentioned in the previous point, can be a good way to still incorporate movement in a meaningful way
3. Aggregating the week: instead of looking at the goal rigidly (20m every day), taking a look at the week as a whole can provide some slack to the plan

### Week level view
The reason I shot for 210 minutes per week (30m per day) as opposed to 140 minutes per week (20m per day) is simple: set the daily limit low, but let yourself extend further if you want to. For cycling, this is really easy because I'll more likely than not bike 40m minimum, but 2hr if I really feel like it. Either way, I accrue hours quickly this way.

I won't want to bike every day though because it is taxing and time consuming, so I can then opt for a 20m walk, or 30-40m weights session. Setting the bar lower for the daily goal helps breed consistency, while the weekly total is more in-line with what I'll do regardless. The reality is, meeting both of these goals doesn't matter. As long as I either move every day, or I get in that 3.5 hours within the week, I've achieved something and that's all I'm hoping for.

### Incremental progress
Fitness is really easy to apply this logic to, since the stakes are nonexistent. I am not going to fail anything in the short-term if I do not move my body. I may get diabetes/dyslipidemia/hypertension in a few years, but, to my point, nothing in the short-term. The same cannot be said if I choose not to do my responsibilities as a student or as an employee. The expectations are also no where as clear because that is life (well school is a bit more clear, but you get the point).

What I'm trying to say is you can apply the same logic towards those areas of life too. Entering a slump of grad school feels reminiscent of the slump I had during my first job out of undergrad. It feels like I haven't achieved what I expected too, but I also don't know what will come next and it feels like a dead-end. I think it's unrealistic of me to know all of these things, and I should try to let it go, so I can focus on what's here now. I can have an impact at where I learn and work because I have some core competencies that are valuable. 

I am good at communicating between technical and non-technical groups, in order to reach a goal. Additionally, I'm an a problem-solver, and quickly gain domain knowledge. My previous experience in personal training, EHR training, and technical support at the TX-APCD all support this. So, cut yourself some slack here.

### Goals for the semester
   
>Building my confidence back up through job-prepping, lining up a practicum opportunity for the spring/summer, and learning more about finance and legal issues in healthcare.
