## What happened

1. Nerd things: `hugo` has seen some gains in functionality (webp processing of photos), initial setup `ICD search app`, and `it-tools` installed
2. Fitness: weight training 2 hours & walking 1 hour means the weekly goal was met
3. Diddly daddling: Kohiko and MDK Noodles

## Making use of Fuji

Since getting the Fujifilm XT-20, I definitely hit that point where the allure kind of fades and I forget that I even have it. That happens a lot when it comes to hobbies. Bringing it back out on Saturady made me realize I enjoy taking pictures of food with it, people not so much. Being able to slap a film sim (glorified filter) on every photo also makes the time in Lightroom almost nil, unless I really want to touch something up for memory keeping. Anywho, I should remember to use it more often.

## Fitnessing

The bike has been in the shop for some time now, which obviously sucks but it has opened the door to more weight training and walking. Keeping moving is important to keeping my sanity after all. I even got to snap a pic of this glorious building (parking garage). False fall is always a disappointment because it feels nice to get a break from the scorching heat that is Houston.

## ICD-10 CM Searching

The idea popped up to make a website to search ICD 10 codes because they're out there to process, and I thought it'd be a fun challenge to get more exposure into tech. More on that later.
